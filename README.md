### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Meghan (she/her), and I use & teach R, with a particular love for `ggplot2` and `quarto`.

:ice_hockey:&nbsp; After many years of contributing to the public hockey analytics community, I now work full-time in sports analytics as the technical product manager of the hockey group at [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com/).

:woman_teacher:&nbsp; I love helping people learn R, particularly by teaching the tidyverse to beginners. I've given several talks and workshops, many focused on sports analytics and all available on my [website](https://meghan.rbind.io/talk/), and in summer 2021, I taught the Statistical Graphics & Visualization course through the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. This course focused on data visualization using R and `ggplot2`, and the public-facing course website (built with [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)) is here: [cmu-36315.netlify.app](https://cmu-36315.netlify.app/).

I can be found on Twitter [@MeghanMHall](https://twitter.com/MeghanMHall), and my website is here: [meghan.rbind.io](https://meghan.rbind.io/).
