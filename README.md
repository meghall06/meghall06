### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Meghan (she/her), and R is my favorite languageâ€”besides emojis. :heart_eyes:

:mortar_board:&nbsp; I use R every day in my career as a data professional in higher ed. Most of that work is private and not on GitHub :disappointed:&nbsp; but right now I'm working on creating internal packages and automating reports with R Markdown!

:ice_hockey:&nbsp; I also like hockey. I use R as a tool for analyzing hockey, and I use hockey as a tool for teaching R! (Particularly the tidyverse, and particularly to beginners.) I have a package called [betweenthepipes](https://github.com/meghall06/betweenthepipes) that hosts learnr tutorials and some sample data, and I've delivered some workshops (available on my website). I hope to expand in this area  this year! 

I can be found on Twitter [@MeghanMHall](https://twitter.com/MeghanMHall), and my website is here: [meghan.rbind.io](https://meghan.rbind.io/).
